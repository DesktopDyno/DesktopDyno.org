title: DC Motor
---

The DC motor performs electromechanical energy conversion using **direct current (DC)**, as opposed to alternating current (AC). DC motors are easy to operate and control since a simple battery can be used as the power source.

Typically, there are two active parts of the DC motor: the **rotor** which rotates with the shaft, and the **stator** which is stationary.

DC motors have two input terminals called the **positive** and **negative** input. In motoring operation, when a positive voltage is applied across the terminals, a current flows in the motor and the shaft spins. Conversely, in generating operation, when the shaft is rotated via an external mover, a voltage appears at the terminals of the motor. The voltage that appears is called the **back-EMF** (back electromotive force) and is directly proportional to the shaft speed. The motor creates torque when a current flows in the winding.
